# Welcome! 
I am currently a postdoc in the [FAIR Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/fairailab) led by [Prof. Hadi Hosseini](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/hadi/index.html), at The Pennsylvania State University. 
Prior to this, I was a postdoc at City University of Hong Kong advised by [Prof. Minming Li](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~minmli/), and at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University advised by [Dr. Bo Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~bo2li/). 

I obtained my PhD degree from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2023, where I was extremely fortunate to be advised by Dr. Bo Li. 
Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2019, where I was a member of the ACM Class. 

From March to May in 2023, I visited University of Oxford, advised by [Prof. Jiarui Gan](https://jgan.xyz/). From March to May in 2022, I also visited Chinese Academy of Sciences, advised by [Prof. Xiaoming Sun](http://english.ict.cas.cn/people/scien/bln/202303/t20230315_328241.html) and [Prof. Jialin Zhang](http://english.ict.cas.cn/people/scien/bln/202303/t20230315_328233.html). 

My research interests lie in computational social choice and especially fair division, algorithm design and analysis.
If you are interested in cooperating or discussing with me, please do not hesitate to to drop me an email.
